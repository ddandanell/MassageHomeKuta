    },
    {
      question: "How is deep tissue different from regular massage?",
      answer: "Deep tissue targets deeper muscle layers using slower, more forceful strokes. It's more therapeutic and less relaxing than Swedish or Balinese massage, focusing on chronic tension and pain relief."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I get deep tissue massage if I have an injury?",

    {
      question: "How often should I get deep tissue massage?",
      answer: "For chronic issues, weekly or bi-weekly sessions are ideal initially. For maintenance, monthly sessions work well. Your therapist can recommend a schedule based on your specific needs."
    },
    {
      question: "Will I be sore after the massage?",
      answer: "Mild soreness for 24-48 hours is common and normal with deep tissue massage. This is similar to post-workout soreness and indicates the muscles are recovering. Drinking water helps reduce this."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you serve hotels near the airport in Tuban?",

      question: "Can couples book deep tissue massage together?",
      answer: "Absolutely! We can arrange two therapists for simultaneous couple sessions. Great for partners who both need therapeutic work."

    {
      question: "What should I do after a deep tissue massage?",
      answer: "Drink plenty of water to flush toxins, avoid strenuous activity for 24 hours, and apply heat or ice to sore areas if needed. Rest helps maximize the therapeutic benefits."
    },
    {
      question: "Do therapists use oil for deep tissue massage?",
      answer: "Yes, we use professional massage oil to reduce friction while allowing for deep pressure. The oil helps therapists work deeply without causing skin irritation."

      question: "Can I request to focus only on my back and shoulders?",
