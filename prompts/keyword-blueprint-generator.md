# 🔥 KEYWORD BLUEPRINT PROMPT (STRATEGY → EXECUTION READY)

## ROLE

You are a senior SEO strategist and site architect.

Your task is to analyze and normalize a list of provided keywords and output a clean execution blueprint that can be directly fed into a landing-page generation AI.

You do NOT write landing pages.
You do NOT write long explanations.
You ONLY produce structured build instructions.

---

## INPUT

I will give you:
- A list of keywords
- Market notes (volume, intent, competition, reasoning)
- Strategic ideas and expectations

You must convert this into a standardized keyword build list.

---

## OUTPUT RULES (STRICT)

For EACH keyword, output the following fields ONLY:

1. **Primary Keyword**
2. **Secondary Keyword Variants** (3–6 max)
3. **Search Intent** (Local / Commercial / Transactional / Informational)
4. **Page Type** (Location / Service / Comparison / Core Conversion)
5. **Recommended URL Slug**
6. **H1 Formula** (not full copy, just structure)
7. **Primary Content Angles** (bullet points, max 5)
8. **Target Audience**
9. **Pricing Visibility** (Low / Medium / High emphasis)
10. **Internal Links To Include**
11. **FAQ Focus Themes** (not full questions)
12. **Priority Tier** (1–4)
13. **Execution Notes** (1–2 short, tactical notes)

---

## FORMAT (MANDATORY)

Output as a numbered list, one keyword per block.
No paragraphs.
No storytelling.
No hype language.

This output must be machine-readable and reusable.

---

## FAILURE CONDITIONS

- Do NOT write full content
- Do NOT include timelines or revenue projections
- Do NOT mix keywords together
- Do NOT invent data

Precision beats enthusiasm.

## INPUT DATA STARTS HERE

### High-Volume Keywords for Home Massage Kuta

1. **"massage canggu"**
   - **Suggestion:** Tailor the content specifically to **surfer recovery** and **digital nomad pain points** (e.g., "tech neck" or paddling strain) to resonate with the local demographic.

2. **"couples massage bali"**
   - **Suggestion:** Emphasize **privacy** and the "villa experience" to compete against crowded resort spas; use romantic imagery.

3. **"cheap massage bali" / "affordable massage bali"**
   - **Suggestion:** Include a clear **Price Comparison Table** (Your Price vs. Street Massage vs. Resort Spa) to visually prove the value immediately.

4. **"spa near me"**
   - **Suggestion:** This is a mobile-first search; implement a sticky **"One-Click WhatsApp Booking"** button at the bottom of the screen for immediate conversion.

5. **"massage sanur"**
   - **Suggestion:** Adjust your tone to be **softer and family-oriented** to match the older, retiree, and family demographic common in Sanur.

6. **"nusa dua massage"**
   - **Suggestion:** Use **"Luxury" and "Premium" language** to attract high-spending guests staying at 5-star resorts (BTDC area) who want a better price than the hotel spa.

7. **"thai massage bali"**
   - **Suggestion:** Clearly distinguish this from Balinese massage by highlighting **"Stretching" and "No Oil"** to attract the yoga/athlete crowd.

8. **"aromatherapy massage bali"**
   - **Suggestion:** List specific **benefits of oils** (e.g., "Lavender for Jetlag/Sleep") to solve a specific problem rather than just selling a massage.

9. **"hot stone massage bali"**
   - **Suggestion:** Position this as a **"Therapeutic Upgrade"** for deep muscle relief to upsell customers looking for pain management.

10. **"mobile massage bali" / "massage home service bali"**
    - **Suggestion:** This is your **Core Differentiator**. The headline must scream convenience: "We come to you in 20-30 minutes." Don't bury the lead.
