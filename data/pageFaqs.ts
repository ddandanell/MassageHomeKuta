    question: "How do I choose the right massage type for my needs in Kuta?",
    answer: "The best massage depends on your goals and preferences. For general relaxation and stress relief, we recommend traditional Balinese massage. If you have muscle pain or sports injuries, deep tissue massage is ideal. For gentle relaxation with aromatherapy benefits, choose our aromatherapy massage. Our therapists can also help you select the perfect treatment when you book via WhatsApp."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between Balinese massage and deep tissue massage?",
    answer: "Balinese massage uses light to medium pressure with gentle stretches and aromatic oils, perfect for relaxation and stress relief. Deep tissue massage applies firm pressure to target chronic muscle tension and knots, ideal for pain relief and sports recovery. Both are available as home massage services throughout Kuta and can be delivered to your villa within 30-40 minutes."
  },
  {
    question: "How long should I book my massage session for?",
    answer: "We recommend 90 minutes for most treatments to allow your therapist enough time to address multiple areas and achieve optimal results. A 60-minute session works well for targeting specific areas like back and shoulders. For the ultimate experience, book our 120-minute session which provides comprehensive full-body treatment with extended relaxation time."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I combine different massage techniques in one session?",
    answer: "Yes, absolutely! Many of our Kuta clients request customized sessions combining techniques. You might enjoy deep tissue work on your shoulders and back, followed by gentler Balinese techniques for your legs. Just let us know your preferences when booking, and our experienced therapists will create a personalized treatment blending different modalities."
  },
  {
    question: "What should I expect during my first home massage in Kuta?",
    answer: "Your therapist will arrive at your villa with all equipment including a professional massage table, fresh linens, and premium oils. They'll set up in your chosen space, discuss your preferences and any areas of concern, then provide your treatment while you relax in complete privacy. After the massage, they'll pack everything and leave your space as they found it."
  },
  {
    question: "Are all massage types suitable for everyone?",
    answer: "Most of our massage services in Kuta are suitable for healthy adults. However, deep tissue and Thai massage may not be ideal for pregnant women or those with certain medical conditions. We offer specialized prenatal massage for expectant mothers after the first trimester. Always inform us of any health concerns when booking so we can recommend the safest, most beneficial treatment for you."
